The NASA Prognostics As-A-Service (PaaS) Sandbox is a simplified implementation of a Software Oriented Architecture (SOA) for performing prognostics (estimation of time until events and future system states) of engineering systems. The PaaS Sandbox is a wrapper around the [Prognostics Python Package (ProgPy)](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/), allowing one or more users to access the features of these packages through a REST API. The package is intended to be used as a research tool to prototype and benchmark Prognostics As-A-Service (PaaS) architectures and work on the challenges facing such architectures, including Generality, Communication, Security, Environmental Complexity, Utility, and Trust.

This is designed to be used with the [Prognostics Python Package (ProgPy)](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/).
