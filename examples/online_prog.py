This example shows how to use the PaaS Client and Server for online prognostics. Prior to running the example start the server in a terminal window with the command:
    python -m prog_server

This example creates a session with the server to run prognostics for a Thrown Object, a simplified model of an object thrown into the air. Data is then sent to the server and a prediction is requested. The prediction is then displayed.
